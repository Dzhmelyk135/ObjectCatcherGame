A simple game created in Python where you control a green block with the arrow keys, and you have to catch the falling red block.
 The speed of the falling block increases the more points you get.
 If you don't catch the object, it's game over.
 The current language support is: English, Italian, German, Spanish and Ukrainian.
 For more information look at the changelogs of the individual versions

 This game is the result of pure boredom, since i'm a student and school just finished, I started this project.
 Good luck everyone
